<h1>Antoine's Top 3 most enjoyable & inspiring US movies at October 2023</h1>


<hr />
<h3>LAW ABIDING CITIZEN</h3>
<p>This movie shows that deep practical knowledge is powerful enough to dissolve<br /> almost any obstacle
and also exercising deep practical knowledge which one has<br /> acquired puts one in the position to manipulated very well structured systems 
and<br /> empower the bearer of such knowledge to benefit from its many uses and applications</p>
<h3>THE ACCOUNTANT</h3>
<p>Some particular type of autism can be a blessing to any professional. In this case<br /> 
a forensic accountant was hired for an investigative audit which he was totally hyperfocused on <br /> 
so much so that nobody could call off his audit of the corporations financials until he had finished <br />
his work was purely passion based and locked in on excellent quality of service. Calling off his <br>
his ongoing audit job meant killing him and trust me this was not an easy task.</p>
<h3>SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION</h3>
Deep knowledge is the best tool for living an excellent life. Even in prison, deep knowledge<br>
deep practical knowledge in collaboration with a strong mentality of hope can destroy mountains<br>
of hinderances and obstacles.

<h4>LIMITLESS</h4>
<p>If this particular movie does not bolster your belief in the endless potential of your own brainpower,<br>
    I do not think any other movie will ever do this for you. This movie tells us that genius is asleep in<br>
    every human individual just waiting for the right biochemical stimulant or supplement to wake it up for<br>
    our own personal transformation and glory.  </p>
